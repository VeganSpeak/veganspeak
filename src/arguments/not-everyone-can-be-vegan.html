title: "Not everyone can be vegan"
---

<h2>Not everyone can be vegan</h2><p>There are certain, extremely rare circumstances where people cannot
be vegan due to uncommon medical conditions or living conditions. But
vegans argue that everyone that can be vegan, should. If someone can’t
there is nothing that can be done about it. Veganism is about <em>doing what
is practicable and possible</em> to end animal exploitation. Most people
reading this have access to a computer, which probably means they can
decide to stop paying industries that harm animals right now.</p><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
